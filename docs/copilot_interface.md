# Using GitHub Copilot as an Interface

This guide explains how to use GitHub Copilot as an alternative interface to the ART Code Generation System, allowing developers to generate code directly through natural language prompts.

## Prerequisites

1. Visual Studio Code
2. GitHub Copilot extension
3. GitHub Copilot Chat extension

## Basic Usage

### 1. Form Analysis
```python
# Analyze the form at https://example.com/form and extract its structure
# This will:
# - Navigate to the form
# - Extract form elements
# - Identify validation rules
# - Map event handlers
```

### 2. API Generation
```python
# Generate a FastAPI endpoint for the form at https://example.com/form
# Include:
# - Data models
# - Validation rules
# - Error handling
# - Documentation
```

### 3. HTML Form Generation
```python
# Create a modern HTML form based on the analysis of https://example.com/form
# Requirements:
# - Responsive design
# - Client-side validation
# - Accessibility features
# - Error messaging
```

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Multi-Step Generation
```python
# Step 1: Analyze the form at https://example.com/form
# Step 2: Generate a FastAPI backend
# Step 3: Create a React frontend
# Step 4: Add authentication
# Step 5: Implement error handling
```

### 2. Custom Framework Selection
```python
# Generate a Django REST API and template for https://example.com/form
# Include:
# - Models
# - Views
# - Serializers
# - URL routing
# - Template rendering
```

### 3. Specific Feature Requests
```python
# Add file upload handling to the form at https://example.com/form
# Requirements:
# - File type validation
# - Size limits
# - Progress tracking
# - Error handling
```

## Example Prompts

### Basic Form Migration
```python
# Migrate the legacy form at https://example.com/form to a modern stack
# Use FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend
# Include all validation rules and event handlers
```

### Complex Form with Dependencies
```python
# Analyze and migrate the form at https://example.com/form
# The form has:
# - Dynamic field dependencies
# - Conditional validation
# - Multi-step submission
# - File uploads
# Generate appropriate code for all these features
```

### Custom Styling and Layout
```python
# Create a modern version of https://example.com/form
# Use Material-UI components
# Implement a responsive grid layout
# Add loading states and animations
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**
   - Include the exact URL of the form
   - Specify the target framework/technology
   - List required features explicitly

2. **Break Down Complex Requests**
   - Split large migrations into steps
   - Focus on one aspect at a time
   - Build up complexity gradually

3. **Include Requirements**
   - Specify validation rules
   - Mention security requirements
   - List performance considerations

4. **Request Documentation**
   - Ask for inline comments
   - Request API documentation
   - Include usage examples

## Troubleshooting

1. **Vague Responses**
   - Make your prompt more specific
   - Include example code
   - Break down the request

2. **Incomplete Code**
   - Request specific components
   - Ask for error handling
   - Include edge cases

3. **Framework Issues**
   - Specify exact versions
   - Mention compatibility requirements
   - Include dependency information

## Example Workflow

1. **Initial Analysis**
```python
# Analyze the form at https://example.com/form
# Focus on:
# - Form structure
# - Validation rules
# - Event handlers
# - Dependencies
```

2. **Backend Generation**
```python
# Create a FastAPI backend for the analyzed form
# Include:
# - Pydantic models
# - Validation logic
# - Error handling
# - API documentation
```

3. **Frontend Generation**
```python
# Generate a React frontend for the form
# Use:
# - Material-UI components
# - Form validation
# - Error handling
# - Loading states
```

4. **Integration**
```python
# Connect the frontend and backend
# Include:
# - API integration
# - Error handling
# - Loading states
# - Success messages
```
